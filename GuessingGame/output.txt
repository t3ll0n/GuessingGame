Purpose: This program uses a binary search tree to implement a guessing game.
The program will load a default database with a few simple questions it will
ask the user or it can load a custom or updated database. If the guess is
incorrect the program will update its database by asking the user a series
of questions

Welcome to the Guessing Game Program!
